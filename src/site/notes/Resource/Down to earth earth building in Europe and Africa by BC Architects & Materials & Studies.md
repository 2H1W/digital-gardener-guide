It is what the word â€˜practiceâ€™ means to BC: a collaborative knowledge through making, an act of â€˜getting closeâ€™ to a material and a method, through processes of trial and error.  #é—œæ³¨

BC perform acts of building, at once action and narrative. It is a performance within the complex and costly effort of generating [[Area/åŸºç¤Žè¨­æ–½\|Infrastructure]] , running across classes and skill sets, across materials and technologies

Through the open ecosystem of BC, we try to trace the full circle in the making of buildings â€“ to go through a series of developments that lead back to the original source, position, or situation, or to a complete reversal of the original position.
