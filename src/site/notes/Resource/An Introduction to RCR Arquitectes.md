## Highlights
Moving past them, the conditions of the location are allowed to enter, creating a dialogue with the place, redefining it, strengthening the positive and correcting any existing shortcomings

Catalan architecture is sober, intense, expressed and structured using climate control mechanisms: porches, blinds, arched windows, a wide range of filters that allow living spaces so ambiguous that one does not know if it is in an interior with an exterior condition or the opposite: an exterior with an interior condition. These are the most characteristic spaces of RCR.  #環境

**The place** where the RCR architects live and work is Olot. The town is surrounded by extinct volcanoes, forming a substrate that has created a special [[微氣候\|microclimate]] with plant species that are unique to the Iberian Peninsula.

The example that best illustrates this is the [Pabellón del Baño](http://www.catalan-architects.com/en/rcr/projects-3/les_cols_restaurant_pavilions_and_marquee-51377).

The planning required an organization and use of the land as if dealing with a Greek temple: a construction that – strongly anchored in the surroundings by the curve of the river (echoed in the shape of the deck), by the riverside vegetation that regulates the structure, by the projections and footprints of the platform that mark the structure – is also a work of its own with its own unique characteristics.

RCR sees steel as a material that can unify a construction on every scale, from the structure itself to the doors and windows, to the façades and furnishings, allowing the space to appear, and distilling it without it being obstructed by added ornamentation.  #材料

**The history** of a place serves as material for RCR's projects. [Laboratorio Barberí](http://www.catalan-architects.com/en/rcr/projects-3/barberi_laboratory-55771), the studio's headquarters, is located in the old foundry that stood there before.

---
The empty spaces left by the foundry ovens have been preserved, as well as the soot on the walls and even the existing holes in the roof.

**The topography** is used by RCR as a positive factor that enhances the value of their buildings. Topography provides structure. Topography provides order. Topography provides the roots and wings (burying and floating) that the architects define themselves by.

---
This means of taking advantage of the topography resulted in a construction that is simultaneously buried and floating, and gave rise to spaces as beautiful as the Casas de la Fosca project.

The living spaces snake through the tops of the existing pines, which are used here as light deposits and solar filters that provide some privacy to the different rooms between them.

**The customs** of public life on the streets, this way of using public space, is characteristically Catalan, and is condensed and crystallized in the void created in [Espacio la Lira](http://www.catalan-architects.com/en/rcr/projects-3/la_lira_theatre_public_domain-51379) in Ripoll, which is built on the footprint left behind by a burned theatre lined simply throughout with steel.

An eccentric bridge creates a new flow from the old city to the market, and is compatible with any possible use for the space. It integrates and reinforces the existing traffic in a way so natural that the bridge seems like it has always been there.

Houses built by RCR offer an architectural style that even transforms into a new category: living in the cracks on the façade.

---
The concept of indoors and outdoors is systematically questioned through the intelligent use of technology, making it possible to literally remove the façade of the building, as shown in projects such as Casa Horizonte and [Casa Entremuros](http://www.catalan-architects.com/en/rcr/projects-3/row_house-55775)  #方法
